## Introduction

I‚Äôm a seasoned software engineer based in Beijing with over 14 years of experience in the software industry. I have a proven ability to effectively work and collaborate in remote settings. My primary focus in recent years has been on cloud operations, leveraging Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, and Python for infra-as-code. I also possess solid expertise in machine learning algorithms, with a particular emphasis on the development of recommendation systems. I am committed to continuous learning and improvement, always seeking to expand my knowledge and stay abreast of the latest trends and technologies in the field.
Moreover, I have normal residency in Hong Kong, which could facilitate any potential future company events or meetings internationally.

## Work Experience

### Software Architect & Data Analyst
#### Tencent Music Entertainment, Beijing, China Mainland ‚Äì (Sept 2017 - Present)
As the software architect in the team, I built, maintained, and operated our infrastructure based on Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, and GlusterFS. This role encompassed everything from creating the cluster from scratch, designing the distributed storage (GlusterFS) and network topology, to managing databases (MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL), ingress (Traefik), monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, InfluxDB, Collectd), CI/CD workflows (GitLab), and logging systems (Elasticsearch + Kibana). I applied a software engineering approach to operations, focusing on automation and metrics-driven decision-making. In the first half of this year, I migrated the entire bare-metal infrastructure to Tencent Cloud, ensuring smooth and observable operations.
As a data analyst, I analyzed large volumes of user behavior data and applied statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to build and improve our music recommendation systems.
As a server-side engineer, I developed complex applications primarily using Node.js, occasionally using Go or Python based on specific project requirements.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, I gained substantial full-time remote work experience, particularly when building our cloud infrastructure. In addition, I have years of part-time remote work experience.
Senior Software Engineer
#### Tencent Holdings Ltd., Beijing, China Mainland ‚Äì (July 2013 - July 2017)
I developed a range of web-based applications primarily using PHP, and occasionally in Go or JavaScript as required. I ensured the functionality and performance of these applications under heavy load.
I built C++ network applications that ran on Linux and communicated via UDP protocol, with access rates exceeding 1 billion times per day.
As the project manager, I was responsible for the technical direction, requirement assessment, progress tracking, and quality acceptance of our outsourcing projects.
During my tenure at this company, I gained valuable part-time remote work experience.
### Software Engineer
#### Perfect World Entertainment, Beijing, China Mainland ‚Äì (Oct 2011 - Jun 2013)
Developed our web-based email application using PHP and JavaScript.
Maintained and operated our Linux servers hosting our web applications.

### Requirement Analyst
#### PaxData, Hangzhou, China Mainland ‚Äì (Aug 2010 - Jun 2011)
Gathered and analyzed POS (Point-of-Sale) software requirements from our marketing team overseas, and documented them in English. I was also responsible for the quality acceptance of outgoing software from our development team.

## Open Source Experience

I‚Äôm an open-source enthusiast. In the past few years, I contributed code to well-known repositories such as Node.js, Google Chromium V8, Spacemacs, JuiceFS, Stellarium, etc. I also contributed to the documentation of Kubernetes to correct or improve expressions on https://kubernetes.io.
Here is my GitHub homepage: https://github.com/rayw000.

## Skills

### Linux
As an experienced Linux operator, I‚Äôm skilled at operating, fine-tuning, and troubleshooting Linux systems, including NGINX based various CGI configurations. I also have knowledge of Linux kernel programming.
### Kubernetes & Docker
I built and manage our team's infrastructure using Docker, Kubernetes, and GlusterFS, and have years of experience as the system administrator of this infrastructure.
### Python & Shell
These are the programming languages I predominantly use to tackle a variety of problems, such as data analysis, automation tasks, and system operations.
### Node.js
In recent years, I've mainly used Node.js to build web applications. I'm also an active contributor in the Node.js community.
### Go & C/C++
I use Go for applications with high performance requirements due to its execution efficiency and handy concurrency mechanism. For performance-sensitive applications, I use C/C++ to obtain optimal performance.
### Database & Cache
